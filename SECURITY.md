# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability?

Just don't. This does not even need an internet connection. If you abuse something, you are just ruining your own experience.

## Reporting a bug?

You know where such reports go. Requires an attached log file from logs/log.txt
I am not going to pay attention to bugs without any logs attached.

If you manage to fix it yourself, go ahead and just tell me exactly how. Please do if you have any understanding of C.

# Please note: I am not going to act fast when it comes to fixing bugs.
