# This is supposed to be some kind of text RPG.

Demo phase. There is a long way to go.

Coding status: Demo has been created, but still needs polishing.

Yes, I have created the demo level, navigation, combat, and events.

To try it, you will have to run `adv.exe` in the command prompt and use difficulty setting "Debug". Then type "pass123" - This part does not have its own message.
Next step - Tons of upgrading and polishing. There is now a long list of goals - `todo.txt`.

I am ready for feedback - Issues and suggestions can be made in the "Issues" section.
Again, I will seldom look there and act on them.
