# This is supposed to be some kind of text RPG.

Can't even call the current state "pre-alpha".

Coding status: First steps, far from a usable state.

The base is somewhat ready. Now I will have to continue slowly coding in a story. Currently, the only working difficulties are "Medium" and "Debug" and are just being tested for combat.
Next step will be creating navigation.

If You submit any issues and pull requests, don't expect a fast response, if any. This is far too incomplete to worry about this.
